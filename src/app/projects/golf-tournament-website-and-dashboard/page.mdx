I built this golf tournament website for a company that offers a mobile golf betting app.

They needed a complete website to manage the live scoring of their tournaments, based on real-time input from the golf players participating in each tournament.

The website features a dashboard for creating and managing tournaments, a landing page, and several pages for each tournament modality, including rankings, daily scores, and brackets.
## Tournament dashboard
This is where the tournament is created and managed. You can create and assign players to tournaments, each player is then assigned to certain rounds so that they can modify and track their own scorecards through the app.

## Landing page
The website landing page is a very simple page that includes a basic call to action and social proof to add credibility to the business.

## Tournament live score viewer
There are several types of tournaments that can be configured through the dashboard, and the live score can be viewed in real time on the websites below.
